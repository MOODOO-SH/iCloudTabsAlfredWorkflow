# iCloudTabs AlfredWorkflow

This workflow retrieves iCloud tabs from the local `~/Library/SyncedPreferences/com.apple.Safari.plist` file for all connected iCloud devices and displays the links.  Tabs from current device are excluded.

## Usage

`tabs` keyword by default.

## Changes

September 5 2013; updated to work when devices in the plist file don't have any tabs.
